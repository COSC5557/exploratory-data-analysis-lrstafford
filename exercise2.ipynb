    "For this exercise, you will have a look at the raw data before doing any machine learning. This is to familiarize yourself with the data, see if there are any potential problems or obstacles for applying machine learning, and if and what preprocessing may be helpful.\n",

    "Your deliverable will be a report, written in a style that it would be suitable for inclusion in an academic paper as the \"Experimental Setup\" section or similar. If unsure, check an academic paper of your choice, for example this one. The level of detail should be higher than in a typical academic paper though. Your report should be at most five pages, including references and figures but excluding appendices. It should have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction: What problem are you solving, how are you going to solve it.\n",
    "Results of the Analysis: Describe the data you're using, e.g. how many features and observations, what are you predicting, any missing values, etc. Include plots as appropriate.\n",
    "Code: Add the code you've used as a separate file.\n",
    "Your report must contain enough detail to reproduce what you did without the code. If in doubt, include more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no required format for the report. You could, for example, use an iPython notebook. Your report should contain a lot of plots or tables to illustrate the data. Describe any issues you found with the data."
